feed-forward-network-deep-learning
Objective:-1. Build a Feed Forward Network for MNIST Classification in Pytorch in not more than 10 epochs.
Number of parameters used in the model ( lower the better)
Validation data accuracy (higher the better)
Experimentation details to reach at the final set of parameters used in the model.
